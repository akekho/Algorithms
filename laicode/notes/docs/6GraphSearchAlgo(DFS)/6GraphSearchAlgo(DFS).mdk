# DFS
* how to implementï¼š easy to use recursion
* common questions:
  * all subsets (no duplicate or duplicate)
  * all permutations (duplicate or no duplicate)
  * all valid permutations of parenthesis
  * 99 cents 
  * Other
    * given an input string = "127222458", return all valid ip? 
      * 4 levels. WHY?
    * permutation of factors of number?
    * randomly generate a maze.
* TWO THINGS BEFORE SOLVING THE PROBLEM?
  * How many layers in the recursion tree?
  * What is the semantic of each layer? / WHAT DOES IT STORE ON EACH LAYER?
  * How many different states we should to try to put on this layer?

# All subsets

# String permutations

# 99 cents

# valid permutation parenthesis
